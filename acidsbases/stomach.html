            <p>Our stomach produces Hydrochloric acid which helps with the digestion of food. Our stomach also makes sure that the inner lining of the stomach is protected from the corrosive effect of the acid.</p>
            <p>If, however you experience indigestion, this means your stomach is producing too much acid.</p>

            <p>People often take antacids to fix such an indigestion problem.</p>
            <p>The antacids often contain some combination of aluminium or magnesium hydroxides (basic) or sodium bicarbonate which works to neutralize the excessive acid in your stomach.</p>
