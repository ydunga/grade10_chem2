            <p>As you move from left to right across a period, the atomic radius decreases. This is because the nucelar charge (number of protons) is also increasing as we move from left to right.</p>
            <p>Due to the stronger nuclear charge, the electrons are pulled closer to the nucleus, which reduces the size of the atom.</p>
            <p>As we move down a group, the atomic size increases.</p>
            <p>This is because as we move down a group, additional shells are being added to the atom.</p>
            <p>With each additional shell, the distance between the outermost electrons and the nucleus increases. </p>
