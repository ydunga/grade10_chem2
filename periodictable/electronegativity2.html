        <p>We've already defined that electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to <b>attract a bonding pair of electrons.</b> </p>
      <p>Electropositivty on the other hand is the tendency of an atom to lose electrons.</p>
      <p>The <b>Pauling scale</b> is used to measure the electronegativity of elements. </p>
      <p>In the periodic table, electronegativity increases as we move to the right.</p>

      <p>What happens if two atoms with a similar level of electronegativity interact with each other?</p>

      <p>If the atoms are equally electronegative, both will have the same tendency to attract electrons. So the atoms will <b>share</b> the electron and on average it will be found halfway between the atoms.</p>
      <p>Such a bond is known as a covalent bond.</p>
      <p>This kind of bond would be common between two atoms of the same element. So H<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

        <div class = "bottompane">
          <div class = "front3">What happens if one atom is more electronegative than the other?</div>
      <p>In this case, the more electronegative atom will attract the bonding electron more than the other atom. </p>
      <p>The atoms will still share the bond, however the end with the more electronegative atom will now be slightly more negative than the other end. </p>
      <p>Such kind of a bond is known as a <b>polar bond.</b> </p>
      <p>A polar bond is a covalent bond in which there is a seperation of charge between one end and the other. </p>
      <p>Polar bonds form between atoms with an electronegativity difference between 0.4 and 1.7</p>
      <p>Water is a polar molecule. </p>

      <p>If there is a large electronegativity difference between atoms, then they will form an <b>ionic bond.</b> The atom with the larger electronegtaivity will have control over the electron in question.</p>
      
      <p>You can think of a polar bond as having an unequal electron density distribution.</p>
